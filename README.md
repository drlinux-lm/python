# Sandbox repo

* [Arcspeed Calculator](https://github.com/vajdao/pyproject/tree/master/arcspeed_calculator) : Useful for calculating arc speed for a specific deg/s at given ranges! Tank gamers gonna love this.

* [Sudoku solver](https://github.com/vajdao/pyproject/tree/master/sudoku_solver) : Because why not? - Merged my separate [sudoku solver](https://github.com/vajdao/sudoku_solver) repo, so I'm gonna archive it soon.

Messing around with all the random testing stuff for Git/Github playground goes into this...

Also, I figured out I'll need a "container" for all my little projects, so this is gonna be it.

# Sandbox repo, also a collection of my random codes, games, ideas & problem solutions.

* [Arcspeed Calculator](https://github.com/vajdao/pyproject/tree/master/arcspeed_calculator) : Useful for calculating arc speed for a specific deg/s at given ranges! Tank gamers gonna love this.

* [Sudoku solver](https://github.com/vajdao/pyproject/tree/master/sudoku_solver) : Because why not? - Migrated from my separate [sudoku solver](https://github.com/vajdao/sudoku_solver) repo for repo clarity.

* [Tamagotchi's minigame](https://github.com/vajdao/pyproject/tree/master/Tamagame): Guessing game from tamagotchi minigame. Again, migrated from my separate [tamagame](https://github.com/vajdao/Tamagame) repo for clarity.


## Future planned projects:
* Leading system for tanks (where to aim lead crosshair on moving objects in order to hit)
* Artillery strike arc system for SPGs ([under development now](https://github.com/vajdao/pyproject/tree/master/ballistics))


### So far the historical description of this repo:
This repo started out as: "Messing around with all the random testing stuff for Git/Github playground goes into this..."

But then I also figured out, that I'll need a "container" for all my projects to quickly throw in somewhere, so this repository gonna exactly serve that purpose.

This project is an as-is, and it might get somewhere at some point ...at some time
